# üëã Hi, I'm Fahad Mohammad Aljahlan

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a computer science student at the University of British Columbia in Kelowna with a passion for software development, AI, and game design. I enjoy building practical tools and fun interactive projects using Java, C#, and Unity. Below, you'll find a selection of my public projects, ranging from mobile apps to physics-based games and machine learning experiments.

## Current Focus
- **Computer Science** student at UBC (previously at Langara College)
- Interested in **machine learning**, **game development**, and **sustainable tech**
- Actively learning more about AI integration, Unity physics, and clean mobile UI/UX

## Featured Projects

### Garbage Classification AI
An AI model that identifies the type of garbage (e.g., recyclable, waste, compost) and guides the user on how to dispose of it properly. Built with a focus on sustainability using image recognition and classification models.

### Carpooling Project
A collaborative Java-based system designed to help users find and offer carpooling opportunities. Focused on backend logic and user management.

### Platformer Studio ‚Äì Coin Dash HUD System
Forked from a UBCO course assignment. Worked on HUD systems, player stats, and score tracking using C# in Unity.

### Third Person Platformer
A 3D platforming game project created with Unity‚Äôs character controller and physics systems.

### Bowling with Physics
A realistic Unity bowling game simulating physics using rigidbodies, collisions, and force dynamics.

### Roll A Ball
A simple Unity project involving movement and object collection mechanics.

### Maze Generator
A Java-based maze game with two types of mazes: basic and enhanced (requires ‚Äúspells‚Äù to open new paths). Focused on algorithm design and object-oriented principles.

### Kitchen Simulator
A Java game simulating a cooking environment, developed as a university team project. Implemented gameplay logic, UI components, and testing routines.

### Simple To-Do List App
Created using Android Studio during a workshop. Includes basic add/delete functionality with a clean and simple interface.

### Angry Birds-like Mini Game
A Unity-based physics game inspired by Angry Birds. Built using C# and YouTube tutorials to explore trajectory physics and collision systems.

## Tech Stack

- **Languages:** Java, C#, Python
- **Frameworks/Tools:** Unity, Android Studio, IntelliJ, Eclipse, GitHub
- **Concepts:** OOP, Data Structures, Algorithms, Game Physics, Machine Learning (intro level)
